# ParkingLord-GameEngine-
A self-made game engine and a simple game based on that. Very simple.

The game is ParkingLord.7z. Unzip it and you can play. Use W S A D to move your car, and tap Space when you think you park at the right place.

The game looks very simple and unpolished. Yet I finished every line of code by myself, except for a very simple Graphic library. I do this to
learn knowledge of C++, GameEngine and some game development techniques.

In this project, I implemented my own memory allocator. It handles New() and Delete(), and Garbage collection. It is faster when allocating small
chunks of memory, as it uses fixed allocator technique.

Based on this, I created my own engine. It has matrices operation, collision detection, message&event system, and other features. Some of them 
are simple, yet reflect my learning process.

Overall, this project shows my skill and knowledge in C++ programming, 3d Math(Linear Algeba), and game design and implement patterns.

In the future, I plan to work on multi-threading, and introducing more C++ 11 patterns into this project.
